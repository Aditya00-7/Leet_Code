//167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
//Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.
//Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.
//The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.
//Your solution must use only constant extra space.

//Example 1:
//Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
//Output: [1,2]
//Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
//Example 2:
//Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
//Output: [1,3]
//Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].
//Example 3:
//Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
//Output: [1,2]
//Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].
//Constraints:
//2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104
//-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
//numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
//-1000 <= target <= 1000
//The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution.


// Approach: Two Pointer Technique
//Since the array is sorted, we can use the two-pointer method:
//Set left = 0 and right = numbers.length - 1
//Loop while left < right:
//If numbers[left] + numbers[right] == target â†’ return [left + 1, right + 1]
//If the sum is less than target â†’ move left++
//If the sum is greater than target â†’ move right--
//This is O(n) time and O(1) space.

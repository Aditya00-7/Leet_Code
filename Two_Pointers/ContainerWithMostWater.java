//Container With Most Water
//You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
//Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
//Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
//Notice that you may not slant the container.

//Example 1:
//Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
//Output: 49
//Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

//Example 2:
//Input: height = [1,1]
//Output: 1

//Constraints:
//n == height.length
//2 <= n <= 105
//0 <= height[i] <= 104
